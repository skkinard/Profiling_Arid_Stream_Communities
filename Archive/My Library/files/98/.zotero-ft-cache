Abstract

Freshwaters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i. e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the foodweb. The different components of climate change (e. g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies.

Usage count

The Usage Count is a measure of the level of interest in a specific item on the Web of Science platform. The count reflects the number of times the article has met a user’s information needs as demonstrated by clicking links to the full-length article at the publisher’s website (via direct link or Open-Url) or by saving the article for use in a bibliographic management tool (via direct export or in a format to be imported later). The Usage Count is a record of all activity performed by all Web of Science users, not just activity performed by users at your institution. Usage Counts for different versions of the same item on the Web of Science platform are unified. Usage Counts are updated daily.

Last 180 days

This is the count of the number of times the full text of a record has been accessed or a record has been saved in the last 180 days. This count can move up or down as the end date of the fixed period advances.

Since 2013

This is the count of the number of times the full text of a record has been accessed or a record has been saved since February 1, 2013. This count can increase or remain static over time.
