Trends in diversity and compositional shifts within coastal river fish and invertebrate communities along a natural precipitation gradient in South Texas. Analyses include:
- Environmental pairs plot to explore covarying environmental variables
- Environmental variable PCA to identify relationships between environmental variables
- Fish diversity regressions against a priori selected environmental variables
- multiiple regression predicting fish diversity, using a dredge method to select the best model
- Flow post-analysis looks at statistically non-significant relationships to check for non linear trends visually using pairs plots
- Constrained Redundancy Analysis of fish and invertebrates with environmental vectors
- F_  = fish, I_ = invertebrate, E_ = environment

## These results were published in a scientific manuscript in PeerJ.

## This is the first chapter of my dissertation so the code reflects my earliest work (functionally but ugly and innefficient).
