    Description:

        Abstract:

         This dataset, termed "GAGES II", an acronym for Geospatial Attributes of Gages for 
        Evaluating Streamflow, version II, provides geospatial data and classifications for 9,322 
        stream gages maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It is an update to the 
        original GAGES, which was published as a Data Paper on the journal Ecology's website 
        (Falcone and others, 2010b) in 2010. The GAGES II dataset consists of gages which 
        have had either 20+ complete years (not necessarily continuous) of discharge record 
        since 1950, or are currently active, as of water year 2009, and whose watersheds lie 
        within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Reference gages 
        were identified based on indicators that they were the least-disturbed watersheds within 
        the framework of broad regions, based on 12 major ecoregions across the United States. 
        Of the 9,322 total sites, 2,057 are classified as reference, and 7,265 as non-reference. 
        Of the 2,057 reference sites, 1,633 have (through 2009) 20+ years of record since 1950. 
        Some sites have very long flow records: a number of gages have been in continuous 
        service since 1900 (at least), and have 110 years of complete record (1900-2009) to date.
        			  
        The geospatial data include several hundred watershed characteristics compiled from 
        national data sources, including environmental features (e.g. climate – including historical 
        precipitation, geology, soils, topography) and anthropogenic influences (e.g. land use, 
        road density, presence of dams, canals, or power plants). The dataset also includes 
        comments from local USGS Water Science Centers, based on Annual Data Reports, 
        pertinent to hydrologic modifications and influences. The data posted also include 
        watershed boundaries in GIS format. 
        			  
        This overall dataset is different in nature to the USGS Hydro-Climatic Data Network 
        (HCDN; Slack and Landwehr 1992), whose data evaluation ended with water year 1988. 
        The HCDN identifies stream gages which at some point in their history had periods which 
        represented natural flow, and the years in which those natural flows occurred were identified 
        (i.e. not all HCDN sites were in reference condition even in 1988, for example, 02353500). 
        The HCDN remains a valuable indication of historic natural streamflow data. However, the 
        goal of this dataset was to identify watersheds which currently have near-natural flow 
        conditions, and the 2,057 reference sites identified here were derived independently of the 
        HCDN. A subset, however, noted in the BasinID worksheet as “HCDN-2009”, has been 
        identified as an updated list of 743 sites for potential hydro-climatic study. The HCDN-2009 
        sites fulfill all of the following criteria: 
        	(a) have 20 years of complete and continuous flow record in the last 20 years 
        (water years 1990-2009), and were thus also currently active as of 2009, 
        	(b) are identified as being in current reference condition according to the GAGES-II classification, 
        	(c) have less than 5 percent imperviousness as measured from the NLCD 2006, and 
        	(d) were not eliminated by a review from participating state Water Science Center evaluators.
        			  
        The data posted here consist of the following items:- This point shapefile, with summary data 
        for the 9,322 gages.- A zip file containing basin characteristics, variable definitions, and a more 
        detailed report.- A zip file containing shapefiles of basin boundaries, organized by classification 
        and aggregated ecoregion.- A zip file containing mainstem stream lines (Arc line coverages) for 
        each gage.

        Purpose:

         This dataset has two purposes: 
        (1) to provide users with a comprehensive set of geospatial characteristics for a large number 
        of gaged watersheds, particularly for gages with long flow record, and 

        (2) to provide a determination of which of those watersheds represent hydrologic conditions 
        which are least disturbed by human influences ("reference gages"), compared to other watersheds 
        within 12 major ecoregions.  Identifying reference gages serves important research goals: for 
        example identifying conditions or goals for stream restoration, climate change studies, and more.

    Access_Constraints: None
    Use_Constraints: The classification assigned in this project (reference or non-reference) was based on our semi-quantitative evaluation of the criteria described in the report, which included both quantitative and qualitative data. Our classification is intended as the best identification of reference-quality sites that we could perform given the limitations of national-scale data, and within the context of the regions we used. It was believed that the deficiencies of national-scale GIS data, which do not capture small diversions, dams or groundwater pumping particularly well, would be supplemented by an examination of ADR remarks and visual examination of every watershed from high-resolution imagery. It is possible that users with localized knowledge may be able to perform a better classification for specific areas. Users of these data should be attentive to potential differences between reference and non-reference gages - for example, watershed size (median size of reference gages = 212 sq km; of non-reference gages = 587 sq km). We also note that it would be possible to use the data posted here to identify a different, but equally valid, set of reference-quality stream gages for other purposes, based on other regions, or which place greater emphasis on specific anthropogenic activities or variables (e.g., urbanization), and that the classification presented here is not intended to be definitive. Any use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government. Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata file is intended to document the data set in nonproprietary form, as well as in ArcInfo format, this metadata file may include some ArcInfo-specific terminology.
