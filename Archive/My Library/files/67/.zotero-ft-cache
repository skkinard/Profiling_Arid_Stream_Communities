Here's what the citation() function gives:To cite R in publications use:

   R Core Team (2014). R: A language and environment for statistical
   computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
   URL http://www.R-project.org/. 

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

   @Manual{,
     title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
     author = {{R Core Team}},
     organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
     address = {Vienna, Austria},
     year = {2014},
     url = { http://www.R-project.org/ },
   }

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it
when using it for data analysis. See also ‘citation("pkgname")’ for
citing R packages.
