    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: File geodatabase Feature Classes were generated from PRISM rasters for each state and merged into a feature class..  Attribute data was cleaned up and a State FIPS field was added.  The merged file was loaded into an SDE database.  See the PRISM web site for more information on the original files http://www.ocs.orst.edu/prism.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      General information about entity and attributes is available from PRISM Data Users Guide (PRISGUID.pdf) delivered with each request.
    Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: Relevant attributes are FIPS_S and PrecipInches.  FIPS_S is a 2-digit FIPS code and PrecipInches is average precipitation in inches.
The value for PrecipInches is the median for each one inch range. For example, a value of 4 in PrecipInches represents the range between 4.000 - 4.999.
