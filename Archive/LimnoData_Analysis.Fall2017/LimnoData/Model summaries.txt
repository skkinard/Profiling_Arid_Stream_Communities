Identifying Climate-Driven effects on animal diversity in Texas Coastal Streams
Abstract:
The current literature indicates that stream order is the primary determinant of stream biodiversity in accordance with the river continuum concept.
In this study, we seek to identify alternative, environmental factors that influence stream ecosystem biodiversity.
The report analyzes the preliminary surveys of 10 streams in the Texas Coastal Prairie, along a sharp precipitation gradient while maintaining similar elevations and stream orders.
Our primary question is whether precipitation is a direct or indirect driver of biodiversity in freshwater streams.
Using multiple regression analysis, we identified the most significant explanatory factors driving fish and invertebrate diversity.
Results:
The results suggest that precipitation influences stream biodiversity indirectly through agricultural runoff and stream morphology.
In order to solidify our findings, future analysis will identify addtional watershed factors that influence agricultural runoff and the mechanisms driving stream morphology in lowland streams.

Sample collection
Data Analysis
I calculated the Shannon Indexes of fish and invertebrate diversities using the VEGAN script in R.
Shannon Diversity Index:
*********Insert formula and explanation of variable

To identify correlated variables, I created augmented pairs plots (Figures 1&2) for fish and invertebrate diveristies.
Each envirnomental variable is plotted against every othe variable and a regression line is added.
The plotted regressions are analyzed for outliers or needed transformations. In variables where relationships or outliers were hard to detect, I applied a log base 10 transformation.
The variables directly relevant to our question and those with correlation coefficients greater than the |0.45| were compiled and used for multi-variable regression modeling.
I created multi-variable regressions using significant variables to identify the maximum R2 possible for predicting diversity.
Using dredge, several models were picked from those with the lowest aICc and p values to examine the explanatory power of various environmental factors.
Using the traditional.forward model approach, we add the most relevant explanatory variables to generate the most simplistic prediction model.
Using the traditional.backward model approach, we remove least relevant explanatory variables from the full model to generate the best prediction model.
I ranked the models based on R2 and adjustd R2 to identify the most significant explanatory variables for predicting biodiversity.
Using excel, simple regressions were plotted for the top 4 explanatory variables for predicting biodiversity

Results:
Summarizing the Augmented Pairs Plot for Fish Diversity (Figure 1)
The log of mean annual precipitation (cm) is positively correlated with fish diversity (r=0.41) and is colinear with mean annual air temperature (°C) (r=-0.86) and the log of Nitrates (mL/L) (r=-0.68)
The mean annual air temperature (°C) is negatively correlated with fish diversity (r=-0.63) and is colinear with the log of Nitrates (mL/L) (r=-0.61).
The acreage of forest within the watershed is positively correlated with fish diversity (r=0.50) and is colinear with Log of ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates (mL/L) (r=-0.64, -0.50, -0.63 respectively).
The depth/widtth ratio of the wetted channel is positively correlated with fish diversity (r=0.50) and is not significantly colinear with other variables affecting fish diversity.
The log of ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates (mL/L) are negative correlated with fish diversity (r= -.75, -.63, -.68 respectively) and are colinear with one another (r= 0.44, 0.69 respectively).
